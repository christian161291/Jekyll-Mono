### [Iris Segmentation]
Project for the course of Artificial Vision and Biometrics Fundamentals at the University of Salerno and concerning the crucial phase of Iris Recognition: Segmentation. Among the various steps of the recognition of iris (acquisition, segmentation, standardization, coding and comparison), segmentation is the fundamental one because it takes care of separating the pupil from the iris and the iris from the sclera to get boundaries to ' Inside of which all the operations of the following phases will be carried out. The project was carried out using the MATLAB software and led to the creation of two different solutions:
1 - Segmentation by Daugman method (differential-differential operator);
2 - Segmentation by Hough transformation and Viola-Jones algorithm, followed by comparison by matrix of similarity.
