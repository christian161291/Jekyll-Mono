I am a student at the University of Salerno, with a degree in Computer Science (graduating in three years, vote: 102/110) and currently engaged in the Master Degree (Security address). In my thesis I have addressed the problem of parallel processing of the DFT (Discrete Fourier Transform) through the use of NVIDIA CUDA, comparing this with the sequential processing.

Although it is not the right place to say it, I do not really like to program, at least not in the general sense of the term. I really enjoy studying a subject and analyzing it, understanding its functioning and its applications.

My aspiration is to become a security expert and make sure everyone can feel safe on the net.
